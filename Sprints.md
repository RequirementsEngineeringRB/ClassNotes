# Sprints

Sprints usually should be 4 weeks long, and each user story is one sprint.
Typically in modern development the sprint duration is 2-3 weeks long instead.

It's rare that everything is finished on a sprint.

# Tasks

The goal is to break them into a bunch of small tasks. They can be rated either a small medium or large.
Medium should be broken into more tasks, while a large would be an epic in of itself.

## Priority

User focus will determine first priority, if they can't use it, it doesn't help.
